# Ping Pong Tournament Generator 

I was tasked by DevelopMe to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.
I was able to create a tournament generator that allows you to create 1v1 tournaments. 
I have taken great effort to make the tool simple and logical.


The completed project can be found at http://daniel.developme.space/ping-pong/

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 
NOTE: No prerequisites are required for running the production build version of the app in the 'Build" folder. Simply open the index.html file in your browser. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will need either "npm" or "yarn" to run the app in development mode. 

npm

### Deployment

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
