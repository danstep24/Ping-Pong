# Ping Pong Tournament Generator 

I was tasked by DevelopMe to create a tool to randomly generate pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names submitted by the user.
I was able to create a tournament generator that allows you to create 1v1 tournaments. 
I have taken great effort to make the tool simple and logical.


## Design

Wireframes for PC and Mobile can be found in the wireframes folder.

I have used a full width header with an animation of the "Pong" game, this was built using CSS key frames.
I feel this adds character and makes the site more aesthetically pleasing.

For the design, I decided to to use a two column layout (BootStrap), with the controls on the left and the players listed on the right. When viewing this on a PC, the user (in most cases) can complete all tasks without ever scolling.
When on a mobile this neatly changes to the a 1 column layout. 

The completed project can be found at http://daniel.developme.space/ping-pong/
Or follow the instructions below to view the project locally on your machine.
 
## Built With

* [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Text editor
* [Git](https://git-scm.com//) - Version control system 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

```
You will need either "npm" or "yarn" to run the app in development mode. 

npm
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm 

yarn
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

```

### Installing

```
npm start or yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.```


### Deployment

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

```
npm run build
```
