# Ping Pong TOURNAMENT GENERATOR

I was tasked by DevelopMe to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.
I was able to create a tournament generator that allows you to create 1v1 tournaments. 
I have taken great effort to make the tool simple and logical.


The completed project can be found at http://daniel.developme.space/ping-pong/

NOTE: No prerequisites are required for running the production build version of the app in the 'Build" folder. Simply open the index.html file in your browser. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will need either "npm" or "yarn" to run the app in development mode.

### Deployment

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
